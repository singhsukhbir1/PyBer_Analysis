# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis
Based on the instructions and data files given by V. Isualize, we are going to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using the Python, Pandas and Matplotlib. Finally, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
- [**Based on Summary DataFrame:**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DXnApf3XdlOIfB3ZjUIJMZzqfbDosLBk/view?usp=sharing)
First in the summary DataFrame, urban city have the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. While in the same three categories, rural cities have the lowest numbers of all results. On the other hand; Rural cities have the highest results in Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver categories.

	
- [**Based on Multiple-line Chart:**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CA4cWhLk4vUtWwQBCL6wxC7SYZTeb4up/view?usp=sharing)
From the Multiple-line chart we can analyze that at the beginning of January month, urban and suburban cities received the lowest total fares. Both urban and suburban received the highest total fares in the last week of February. While, rural cities have the highest total fares collected at the start of April, the lowest fares are shown in the middle of February and second week of janurary. 




## Summary
To summarize, there are some recommendations that can be implied and  tested among cities.
- First, in rural cities, the average fare per ride is very high. That could be the reason that people avoid ride-sharing. Decreasing the fares might attract more customers.
- Secondly, in urban cities, the average fare per driver is too low in compare to others.  Hiring of drivers should be controlled to provide each driver with a good fare.
- In last, more drivers could be hired in suburban cities, because the average fare per driver is almost more than double that of urban cities.
